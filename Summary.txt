I added Axios, a library made for http client request of async functions.

I added a proxy into package.json to allow for easier url path. 
    What a proxy is? 
    It tells the development server to proxy any unknown requests, basically requests that didn't match a static file(predefined path or file) to that proxy u set up.

Added hashing functionality for passwords by utilizing bcrypt, a library made for passwords hashing. Will do more research on this once i wake up tmr.

Single.jsx axios is for routing to the backend of the website, that's why its /api/posts, check index.js in api folder for clarification on why.
    - also set a condition that if username of post is not the same as the logged in, it'll remove.
    - for some reason, when console log currentUser, it returns a parameter with the name of "other", in which it contains all the information, but through another layer. Might wanna check authController.js in api, wtf?
Finally found the fix, take a look at the parameter for axios.delete within the Single.jsx, add withCredentials in so it will log your cookies in.

ToDo:
    + (!) Fix the bug where the Single posting website breaks when user is logged out.
    + Finish with addPost functionality.
    + Add user's information modification functionality.
    + Remove dummy data for sidebar, and have it generated (maybe based on recommendation algorith?) dynamically from the database instead.
